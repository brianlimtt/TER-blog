### 1. What the Guide Says
In reading the guide from the Data Science Guide on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I gathered the following key points:

**Purpose of EDA**
- EDA is the step *after* feature engineering and acquiring data, and *before* modelling.  
- Its goal is to use summary statistics and visualizations to understand the nature of the data, detect quality issues, see patterns, and formulate hypotheses.  
- Simplicity in visualization is emphasised: the goal is for someone to understand a figure in a few seconds.

**Types of Data**
- Structured (numerical, categorical) vs unstructured (text, images, audio).  
- Structured categorical: nominal or ordinal; structured numeric: interval or ratio.  
- Binning numeric into categorical and encoding categorical into numeric are techniques discussed.

**Summary Statistics**
- Single numeric variable: mean, median, mode, min, max, range, quartiles, variance, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis.  
- Categorical variables: counts of each category.  
- Bivariate: correlation, chi-squared, t-tests / ANOVA.

**Visualisation**
- Univariate numeric: histograms, box plots.  
- Bivariate numeric: scatter plots (or line charts if time-ordered).  
- Multivariate: prefer multiple simple charts or dimensionality reduction rather than confusing 3D plots.  
- Categorical: bar charts or waffle charts instead of pie charts.  
- Iterate: make assumptions → visualize → refine → model → visualize results → tune.

**Conclusion**
- EDA is hands-on; plotting and examining real data is crucial.  
- Clarity and simplicity are more important than fancy graphics.

### 2. My Old EDA Approach
Here’s how I used to conduct EDA on my datasets:

1. Load data → view head, check missing values, basic stats.  
2. Plot histograms for numeric variables; bar charts for categorical ones.  
3. Compute correlation matrix; scatter plots for interesting pairs.  
4. Jump into modelling (decision tree, linear regression) then check residuals.  
5. Visualize model outcomes (predicted vs actual).  
6. Sometimes used 3D plots and pie charts for categorical distributions.

### 3. Observations: Where the Guide and My Approach Agree
- Both start EDA before modelling.  
- Both use summary statistics and basic visualizations.  
- Correlation checks among numeric features are consistent with the guide.  
- Visualizing model outcomes aligns with the iterative cycle of EDA.

### 4. Observations: Where My Approach Diverges or Can Improve

| Topic | Guide Recommendation | My Shortcoming |
|-------|--------------------|----------------|
| **Avoid unnecessary visuals** | Keep plots simple; understandable in seconds | I sometimes created 3D plots or pie charts for aesthetics |
| **Pie charts for categorical** | Avoid pie charts; use bar/waffle charts | I have used pie charts out of habit |
| **Encoding & binning** | Explore binning numeric and encoding categorical during EDA | I often leave it until modelling |
| **Multivariate visualization** | Avoid confusing 3D plots; consider dimensionality reduction | I used 3D plots without clear purpose |
| **Iterative loop** | Assumptions → visualize → refine → model → visualize → refine | My workflow jumps to modelling too quickly |
| **Focus on data quality & patterns** | Examine outliers, distribution shape, interactions, missing value patterns | I check basic stats but don’t always fully explore patterns |

### 5. Actions: How I’ll Update My Workflow
1. **Replace Pie Charts**: Use bar/waffle charts for categorical variables.  
2. **Minimalist Visuals**: Only create charts understandable in <3 seconds; avoid unnecessary 3D plots.  
3. **Integrate Binning & Encoding Early**: Explore transformations during EDA.  
4. **Explore Multivariate Patterns**: Use dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA) for complex datasets.  
5. **Emphasize Iterative Cycle**: Explicitly follow assumptions → visualize → refine → model → visualize → refine.  
6. **Focus on Data Quality & Patterns**: Check outliers, skewness/kurtosis, variable interactions, and variable types.  
7. **Document Findings as Story**: Write EDA results as a narrative: “Here’s what I observed and how it informs the next steps.”

### 6. Conclusion
Reading the Data Science Guide’s EDA chapter reminded me that EDA is more than plotting charts. It’s about deeply understanding your data, iterating, and making choices that reveal patterns clearly. Moving forward, I’ll adopt a more structured, minimalist, and iterative EDA workflow to make my analysis more robust and readable.
