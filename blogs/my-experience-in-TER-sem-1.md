# Final Reflection: What I Learned in the TER Course

## Introduction

The **Technology, Engineering, and Research (TER)** course has been one of the most challenging and rewarding courses I’ve taken. Over the duration of the course, my blog posts documented a steady progression from basic data exploration to building and evaluating predictive models using real-world datasets.  

This final reflection ties together what I learned across the course—both technically and conceptually—and how the different units contributed to my understanding of data science, statistics, and analytical thinking.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Learning to Understand Data First

One of the most important lessons from the TER course was that **no model should be built before understanding the data**. Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I learned how to:

- Identify trends and patterns in datasets  
- Detect outliers and inconsistencies  
- Explore relationships between variables using visualizations and summary statistics  

EDA helped me move beyond simply “running code” and instead focus on asking meaningful questions about the data. Many of my earlier blog posts emphasized how EDA guided later decisions in feature selection and modeling.

## ISLP and Statistical Thinking

Using concepts from **ISLP (Introduction to Statistical Learning)**, I learned how statistical ideas translate into practical modeling decisions. Rather than treating models as black boxes, the course emphasized:

- Understanding assumptions behind models  
- Interpreting coefficients and relationships  
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics  

This unit strengthened my ability to justify *why* a model works, not just whether it produces accurate predictions.

## Linear Regression: Building Interpretable Models

Linear regression was one of the foundational tools we explored in depth. Through this unit, I learned:

- How predictors influence a response variable  
- The importance of residual analysis and model diagnostics  
- The tradeoff between simplicity and accuracy  

Linear regression taught me that interpretability matters. Even when more complex models exist, simpler models can provide valuable insight into the structure of the data.

## Classification: Making Decisions from Data

The classification unit expanded my understanding of how data science can be used to make categorical decisions. I learned how to:

- Distinguish between regression and classification problems  
- Evaluate classifiers using metrics such as accuracy and error rates  
- Understand the implications of false positives and false negatives  

This unit emphasized that model evaluation depends heavily on context, and that choosing the right metric is just as important as choosing the model itself.

## Units and Cumulative Learning

One of the strengths of the TER course was its **unit-based structure**, where each topic built on the previous one. Concepts introduced early—such as data cleaning and EDA—reappeared repeatedly in later units like regression and classification.  

Over time, I realized that these units were not isolated topics, but pieces of a larger workflow: understanding data, building models, evaluating results, and communicating insights.

## Suggestions & Course Structure Reflection

The TER course was **well-structured and thoughtfully organized**, with each unit introducing essential skills and concepts. However, one challenge I experienced was that **it wasn’t always clear how certain lessons would be used later in the course**.

At times, concepts felt abstract when first introduced. It was only later—when working on larger projects or cumulative analyses—that their importance became clear. Knowing the **end goal earlier on** could help students better connect each lesson to the bigger picture.

A possible improvement could be:
- Clearly outlining the **final objectives** or example end projects at the start of the course  
- Briefly explaining how each unit contributes to those outcomes  

This would allow students to work more intentionally toward a goal, rather than realizing the value of certain concepts only in hindsight.

## Final Thoughts

Overall, the TER course significantly strengthened my analytical skills and understanding of data-driven decision making. I learned not only how to build models, but how to think critically about data, assumptions, and results.

Through EDA, ISLP concepts, regression, classification, and cumulative units, I gained a deeper appreciation for the **process** behind data science. While the technical skills were valuable, the most important takeaway was learning how to approach complex problems methodically and thoughtfully.

This course has laid a strong foundation for future work in data science, research, and analytical fields.

I would truly love to take this course again in the future and I recommend it to  all students, no matter what field they are interested in.
